/*
  Write a program that simulates a risk/risiko fight using 6 dices.

  How does it work?
  When a player attacks another player he uses 3 dices, the red is always the attacker and the blue is the defender.

  You have to compare the dice with the highest number to simulate the fight.
  N = first highest number
  M = second highest number
  O = third highest number

  If the numbers are equal, the defensor (blue) wins.

  Output:
  Red dices:
  6 (N)
  3 (M)
  2 (O)

  Blue dices:
  5 (N)
  3 (M)
  1 (O)

    R    B
  N 6 vs 5 => red win
  M 3 vs 3 => blue win
  O 2 vs 1 => red win
